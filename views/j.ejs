                <h2><i class="fas fa-cloud-rain topic-icon"></i> Depression</h2>
                <p class="topic-p">It's more than just a bad day or feeling "blue." Depression is a common but serious
                    mood disorder that affects how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping,
                    eating, or working. It can feel like a heavy weight that you can't just "snap out of."</p>

                <span class="topic-sub">Biological & Environmental Factors:</span>
                <p class="topic-p">Research suggests that depression doesn't spring from simply having too much or too
                    little of certain brain chemicals. Rather, there are many possible causes, including faulty mood
                    regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events (abuse, conflict, death, or
                    major changes), medications, and medical problems.</p>

                <span class="topic-sub">Symptoms to Watch For:</span>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 2rem; color: var(--text-gray); margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    <li>Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" mood</li>
                    <li>Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism</li>
                    <li>Irritability</li>
                    <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities</li>
                    <li>Decreased energy or fatigue</li>
                </ul>

                <span class="topic-sub">Actionable Coping Strategies:</span>
                <p class="topic-p"><strong>1. Move your Body:</strong> Exercise can be as effective as medication for
                    some. It releases endorphins and rewires the brain.<br><strong>2. Challenge Negative
                        Thoughts:</strong> When you think "I'm a failure," ask yourself: "Is there actual evidence for
                    this?"<br><strong>3. Seek Support:</strong> Therapy (CBT) and medication are highly effective.</p>

                <div class="myth-fact">
                    <p><strong>MYTH:</strong> Depression is a sign of weakness.</p>
                    <p><span>FACT:</span> Depression is a medical condition, like diabetes or heart disease. It takes
                        strength to survive it and seek help.</p>

                <h2><i class="fas fa-wind topic-icon" style="color: var(--accent-color);"></i> Anxiety Disorders</h2>
                <p class="topic-p">Anxiety is your body's natural response to stress. It's a feeling of fear or
                    apprehension about what's to come. But when feelings of intense fear and distress become
                    overwhelming and prevent us from doing everyday activities, an anxiety disorder may be the cause.
                </p>

                <span class="topic-sub">The Science of Fear:</span>
                <p class="topic-p">Anxiety involves the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes emotions. In
                    anxiety disorders, the amygdala may be faster to react to "threats" (even if they aren't real
                    threats), sending your body into fight-or-flight mode unnecessarily.</p>

                <span class="topic-sub">How to avoid & Cope:</span>
                <p class="topic-p"><strong>Grounding Techniques:</strong> Try the 5-4-3-2-1 method. Acknowledge 5 things
                    you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste.<br><strong>Limit
                        Stimulants:</strong> Caffeine and alcohol can aggravate anxiety.<br><strong>Worry Time:</strong>
                    Set aside 10 minutes a day specifically to worry. When worries come up outside that time, write them
                    down for later.</p>

                </h2>
                <p class="topic-p">PTSD is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking,
                    scary, or dangerous event. It is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. Fear
                    triggers many split-second changes in the body to help defend against danger or to avoid it.</p>

                <span class="topic-sub">Key Symptoms:</span>
                <p class="topic-p">Flashbacks (reliving the trauma over and over), bad dreams, frightening thoughts,
                    avoiding places/events that are reminders of the experience, and being easily startled or "on edge."
                </p>

                <span class="topic-sub">Healing Paths:</span>
                <p class="topic-p">Trauma-focused psychotherapies are the most recommended treatment. This includes
                    therapies like Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and
                    Reprocessing).</p>

                <p class="topic-p">Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive
                    and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet
                    constant demands.</p>

                    Sense of failure and self-doubt. Detachment, feeling alone in the world. Loss of motivation.</p>

                    stress.<br>3. <strong>Resilience:</strong> Build your resilience to stress by taking care of your
                    physical and emotional health.</p>
